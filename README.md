# gdsfactory-mzi

Python code to generate the layout for the edx course "Silicon Photonics Design, Fabrication and Data Analysis" (Phot1x) from the University of British Columbia

# Devices

## MZI

The layout consists of 6 MZI with differences in optical path of 25, 45, 65, 85, 105 and 125 Âµm

## De-embedding structure

The structure is made of 2 grating couplers connected by a waveguide to study the insertion loss
